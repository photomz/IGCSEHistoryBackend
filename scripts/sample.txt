Question 
Answer 
Marks 
1(b) 
Why did Frederick William IV’s refusal of the Imperial German crown matter? 
6 
 
Level 4 Explains TWO reasons 
6 
 
Level 3 Explains ONE reason 
4–5
 (Four marks for one explanation, five marks for full explanation)  e.g. 'This was important because it showed how important t
he princes were and how weak parliaments, like the Frankfurt 
Parliament, were. Frederick William refused the crown because it
 was offered to him by a parliament and not by the princes. 
In his eyes this devalued the offer. He did not think the people had the right to make this offer. The only people that could d
o 
this were the princes. This shows that parliaments were not very important or powerful.' 
 
 
Level 2 Identifies AND/OR describes reasons 
2–3
 (One mark for each identification/description)  e.g. 'It showed the powerlessness of the Frankfurt Parliament.' 'It caused the disintegration of the Frankfurt Parliament.' 'It showed that he did not want a crown offered to him by a parliament.' 'It showed the princes were more important than a parliament.' 'It really meant the defeat and end of the revolution.' 'It showed the power/importance of Prussia.' 'It showed revolution could not be brought about by parliamentary means.' 'It showed the weakness of nationalism, liberalism and democracy
 in Germany and that they could not achieve unification 
without power.'

Question 
Answer 
Marks 
1(c) 
Which was more important in the 1848 revolutions, liberalism or nationalism? Explain your answer. 
10 
 
Level 5 Explains with evaluation 
10
 As Level 4 plus evaluation.
 
 
 
Level 4 Explanation of both sides 
7–9
 A L4 answer will have a minimum of three explanations (2 on one side; 1 on the other). This will be worth a mark of 7. Fuller explanation of one issue to be given two marks. An answer which only has one explanation on one side of the argument cannot be awarded more than 8. 
 
 
Level 3 One-sided explanation OR one explanation of both sides 5 to 6 marks 
4–6
 More detailed explanation of one issue to be given two marks.  e.g. ‘The growth of liberalism was more significant in the revolutions. The middle classes wanted the freedom to vote, freedom of speech to express their views and freedom of the press. M
any in Austria were particularly unhappy with Metternich's 
repressive way of governing, while in Prussia Frederick William
 encouraged liberalism by hinting that the country could have a 
constitution. The Frankfurt Parliament wanted a constitution 
with a parliament elected by secret ballot and the emperor a 
constitutional monarch. This shows how important liberal ideas were.' OR e.g. ‘There was growing nationalism in Germany with a gr
owing sense of German identity, especially among the middle 
classes. People felt that Germany could never be strong unless it was unified. The importance of nationalism can be seen with the formation of the Frankfurt Parliament. This had re
presentatives from different German states and called for the 
creation of a German constitution for a united Germany. This shows how central nationalism was to the revolution.'
